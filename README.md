## Models 

Models to consider after reading survey paper -

  TETFN (A text enhanced transformer fusion network for multimodal sentiment analysis)
  Auto-ML based Fusion (An automl-based approach to multimodal image sentiment analysis)
  TIMF (Two-level multimodal fusion for sentiment analysis in public security)
  MAG-BERT (Integrating multimodal information in large pretrained transformers)
  BERT-like (Jointly fine-tuning” bertlike” self supervised models to improve multimodal speech emotion recognition)
  MMML (Multimodal Multi-loss Fusion Network for Sentiment Analysis)

## How to use preprocessing notebook

Use the preprocessing notebook to preprocess the dataset . Currently it segregates the data into image and text and same for labels. 
1. Change the file location as per your paths in your environment.
2. Run the notebook.
